The students
know the specific constellations and traditions and transnational influences that have led to different answers to the question of how to teach management and which management methods to teach;
have a better understanding of the historical and cultural conditionality of management knowledge due to this historical perspective on the different approaches to managerial education.
The seminar examines the history of management education in German-speaking countries after World War II up to the present. In particular, two levels of this history will be examined: on the one hand, the various initiatives and institutions of management education that have emerged in emulation of and in distinction from American business schools. And secondly, the history of personnel management concepts, motivational techniques and management models which - mostly originating in the USA - were taught at European business schools, discussed in the trade press or in some cases found their way directly into companies.
