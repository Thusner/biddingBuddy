The content is based on three components that build on each other.
In part 1 (theory), students get an insight into some of the most important and currently most relevant psychoâ and sociological theories in the context of consumer behavior. In particular, selected concepts / theories from the following areas are dealt with: motivational theories, theory of cognitive dissonance, identity theories and the concepts of "Extended Self" and "Psychological Ownership", the theory of "Embodied Cognition", Constructal Level Theory and selected ideas from semiotics. In addition to the joint theoretical discussion of these concepts, the event places a special focus on their application to specific marketing phenomena and research questions.
In part 2 (research design and data collection) the students will get an overview of the methods with which data can be collected. In particular, they will learn the strengths and weaknesses of the individual methods so that they can then critically assess and apply them. In addition, socially relevant topics in the area of ââdata privacy, mobile sensing and data breaches are discussed. At the end of the 2nd part you should know how to collect data correctly and which methods are best suited to answer various research questions.
In part 3 (data evaluation), the students are then instructed to evaluate data themselves. You should understand various analysis methods such as variance analyzes or advanced regression analyzes (e.g. non-linear models, moderated regression, mediation models, spotlight and floodlight analyzes) and be able to apply them yourself.
    
 Based on the three parts, the students carry out their own research projects in which they directly apply the content they have learned (from theory / research question to data collection and data analysis). The research projects are carried out in groups. The students are accompanied by the lecturers throughout the research process (e.g. through staggered coaching sessions).
