The main goal of the course Buyer Psychology is to provide students a solid foundation for critical thinking on peoplesʹ judgments, decision making, and choices they make as consumers in the retail environment. In particular, the course will focus on how consumers process a variety of informational cues in online and brick‐and‐mortar stores and how these cues influence their purchase and consumption behaviors. For example, students will learn how consumersʹ perceptions, choices, and purchase decisions will be influenced by (1) different ways of communicating prices and promotions, (2) the presentation of retail assortments, (3) retail store atmospherics and sensory inputs (e.g., music, smell, color), (4) personalization and recommendation systems in e‐commerce, (5) web technologies and online social interaction, etc. Although the course will address the normative issue of how individual decisions should be made, its focus is on the descriptive issue of how decisions are actually made and how individual processes of judgment and choice might be improved to ultimately increase consumer and societal welfare (e.g., by nudging consumers to make more healthy food choices, to better control spending, to increase savings, etc.). 
Course content 
The course content of Buyer Psychology is based on theories and concepts of (1) social psychology and (2) behavioral economics and is designed to provide students with a solid foundation of critical thinking about the rational and irrational behaviors of individuals as consumers. By focusing on the retailing context, students will learn how marketing mix instruments influence consumersʹ cognitive and affective processes that underlie shopping and consumption behaviors. Whereas the lecturers of the course will present the relevant psychological theories and discuss their implications for consumer behavior, the students are required to generate ideas on how to design retail environments that support retailersʹ and marketersʹ goals and, at the same time, nudge consumers to make ʺbetterʺ purchase and consumption decisions which ultimately increase consumer and societal welfare.

Learning and teaching is designed to support a strong experiential learning focus consisting of lectures, class discussions, and a behavioral experiment conducted by the students.A written examination on the topics covered during the semester will take place at the end of the term.
