Increasing fragmentation of media consumption, growing popularity of ad blocking software, decreasing trust in advertising messages - the challenge of addressing the right consumers with the right messages is more difficult for companies than in the past due to these developments. This is why marketing professionals now often supplement the traditional communication mix with the component Influencer Marketing. Influencers are creative individuals who regularly distribute content to their audience via social platforms such as YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat and are ready to integrate brands into this content.
As part of the course, the latest scientific findings in the field of influencer marketing are conveyed. Above all, it is about transferring theoretical knowledge into current communication practice. The focus of the event is therefore the processing of a real case in cooperation with a practice partner.
The course is taught by Prof. Dr. Torsten Tomczak headed. The students also receive input from experienced companies and experts from the social media world.
