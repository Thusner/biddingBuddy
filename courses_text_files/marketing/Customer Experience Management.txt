Course content
ʺThe (total) customer experience is an iterative and dynamic process, which flows from pre‐purchase (incl. search) to purchase and post‐purchaseʺ(Lemon & Verhoef, 2016). In short: If marketeers want to make their company more customer‐centric, they will have to align the entire company along the customersʹ needs. A customer‐centric strategy is a first step in the right direction ‐ but nothing more. To successfully implement a customer‐centric strategy, theʺhardʺandʺsoftʺfactors of customer centricity must be brought into harmony and the stumbling blocks on the way to the customer must be avoided. In this course, students are taught how to improve the customer experience by identifying, mapping and correcting the touchpoints along the customerʹs journey.
Course structure
The course will be taught as a multi‐day intensive program, in which participants learn how to think about customer experience. Each lesson gives insight into one aspect of the central topic and is taught via a combination of lectures, case studies, recent research studies, and input lectures from industry experts as well as self‐study.
