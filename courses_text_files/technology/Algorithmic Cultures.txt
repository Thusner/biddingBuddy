Algorithms Leave hardly any aspect of culture untouched. So many social and cultural practices are today shaped or driven by algorithms. Whether it is dating (the selection of suitable partners), finance (credit rating), or war (drone warfare), all of these have been revamped in the image of the algorithm. While algorithms at first might seem simple, they are never singular and never merely technical: when we study them, we quickly discover their complexity in terms of their social, cultural and technical aspects. We can speak of algorithmic cultures because of the way in which algorithms remake cultures in the plural, and themselves become part of cultures of consumption and of work, of play and of war. In this class we will explore, from a science and technology studies perspective, what algorithms are, how we can speak of algorithmic cultures, look at a number of fields in which algorithms have remade social and cultural practices, and discuss some key concerns associated with the way algorithms impinge on cultures.
