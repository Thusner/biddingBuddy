The course is composed of four main parts and covers the following material:1st Part ‑ Secret Key Cryptography: We will analyse how secret key cryptography is employed to achieve confidentiality.We will cover a small selection of classical cryptosystems, including substitution and transposition ciphers that were historical examples of secret key cryptography. We will describe how one time pad works, what are the stream ciphers and how block ciphers work. We will discuss components used in constructions of block ciphers (e.g. feistel networks) and describe concrete constructions e.g. AES, DES.2nd Part ‑ Public Key Cryptography: We will discuss the notion of public key cryptography, see well known public key cryptosystems (textbook RSA, El Gamal). Describe attacks against existing schemes and how they can be avoided.3rd Part‑ Data Integrity: We will discuss how we can achieve data integrity using hash functions, message authentication codes and public key signatures. We will see vulnerabilities of existing schemes and how we can secure them.4th Part ‑ Cryptographic protocols: We will describe how we employ cryptographic primitives in order to design cryptographic protocols between two or more parties to achieve identification, key agreement and secure multi‑partycomputation.
