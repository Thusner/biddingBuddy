Being able to write a simple program and understand the basics of programming is a skill that every student nowadays should possess. Programming is not very difficult ‑ a program is just a list of precise instructions that the computer will follow ‑ and it can be a lot of fun. Learning to program is like learning a new language, once you know the verbs and pronouns as well as some grammar, you can already form a sentence. In this block course students will learn the basic commands and also the basic computational thinking (the grammar) behind programming and will already be able to code their own small projects. After the course students will also be able to further deepen their programming skills on their own ‑ students will have the necessary tools to find and apply new information to their existing knowledge.
