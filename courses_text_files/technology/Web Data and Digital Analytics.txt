With the proliferation of mobile devices and the growth of user‑generated content, we see an unprecedented growth of individuals producing content themselves and interacting, sharing, and consuming this content through social media and other channels. A key challenge in research and business practice is to make informed decisions based on the properties of those exchanges for applications such as new product introductions, crime prevention, or even campaigning (such as in politics).This course is designed to introduce students to the concepts and statistical methods to collect, visualize, and analyze data streams that cover such relational properties. This course puts an emphasis on data types that are typically found in social media applications and how to analyze the relational properties of such data. This course focuses on the query, visualization, an analysis of textual, voice and relational network data (social network analysis and text mining).We will first cover the basics of R, an open‑source statistical software. Second, we will cover ways to crawl, analyze, and make inferences using textual data (such as accessing and analyzing data via Twitter and other applications). Third, we will coverways to analyze network and audio data, detecting communities from networks and extracting information from voice data.
