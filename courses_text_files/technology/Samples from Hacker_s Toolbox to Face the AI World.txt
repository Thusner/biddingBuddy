Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence. A world populated also by Machines, or Technical Beings. What about HumansBeingsʹ intelligence?Philosophers have talked a lot about technology. Unfortunately, on the whole they have ignored and continue to ignore almost all of the technology itself: according to the philosopher G. Simondon it is a matter of ʺtechnical alienationʺ, a disease caused mainly by a general lack of technical culture.Anthropological approaches are focused on the human as a subject that makes use of technical objects, per se ʺneutralʺ, but often perceived as oppressive, or liberating. These approaches therefore oscillate between the technophobic dystopia and the technophileutopia.We propose a completely different approach: an experiential one, in which humans live with technical beings in a common world. This Approach is rooted in real‑world hacking experiences.A quick disclaimer: obviously, hackers we are inspired by are by no means criminals. Hackers we like are curious persons, interested in the functioning of the machines, digital or analog. Persons animated by a hacker attitude.
