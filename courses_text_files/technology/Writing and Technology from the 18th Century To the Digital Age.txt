Weʹll investigate how literary texts (and their producers) negotiated technological change, from the 18th century through the digital age; we will follow discourses on technology through various movements and historical period (Enlightenment;romanticism; modernist/postmodernism); changes in the way we write and read have occurred at various moments in Westernhistory (just think of the Gutenberg revolution); yet with the digital age changes have become even more pronounced. As writerSven Birkerts argued, ʺscreen and book may exhibit the same string of words, but the assumptions that underlie their significance are entirely different depending on whether we are staring at a book or a circuit‑generated text.ʺ This suggests that technological progress not changes our assumptions about literary works, but that it actually determines how we write and read.
