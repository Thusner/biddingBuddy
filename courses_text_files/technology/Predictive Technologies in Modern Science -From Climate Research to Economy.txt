Predicting the behavior of complex systems (the climate, the economy, human health etc.) is a major goal of modern science. In This seminar, we take a look at the historical development of predictive techniques in modern science with a special emphasis on climate science and the epistemological aspects of predictions. Another important topic will be the increased use of dataâ€‘driven predictive technologies in decision making. Thinking about the potential and the limitations our predictive capacities will facilitate an adequate understanding of the goals and methods of modern science and technology more generally.
