Nuclear weaponry is perhaps the most dangerous technology ever invented. If used in a full‑scale war, it would probably destroy most, maybe even all, human life on the planet. Nuclear weapons are also a peculiarly American technology: the UnitedStates was the first to develop them, and it remains the only nation to ever use them in war. During the Cold War, the Bomb pervaded American thought and culture, only to curiously vanish from popular consciousness after the collapse of theCommunist East. Today, however, nuclear anxiety has returned in the context of American tensions with North Korea, Iran, andRussia.This American Studies course investigates Americaʹs most apocalyptic technology from a cultural‑historical perspective. We will study the longstanding American desire for a ʺsuperweapon,ʺ the invention of the atomic bomb and debates over the atomic bombing of Japan in 1945, the development of complex missile systems, Cold War civil defence and nuclear strategy, scientific debates about environmental effects of large‑scale nuclear war (nuclear winter and human extinction), popular representations of nuclear weapons as ʺtechnics‑out‑of‑controlʺ (e.g., the Terminator franchise), and the contemporary politics of nuclear deterrence. We will approach our subject matter through a diverse assortment of historical texts, journalism, fiction, film, and television.
